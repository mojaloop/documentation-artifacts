## Roadmap Themes:
- **Product Readiness:** Be Feature Complete for existing RFP responses for National Switch Procurement
- **Accelerate Engagement with the Value Proposition:** Help the non-tech ecosystem connect, engage and feed back to us better with technology demonstrators not slideware
- **Accelerate Developer Onboarding:** Remove Friction from joining the Tech Community ("Developer Relations")
- **Support Live Deployments:** Live Deployment Customer Feedback; Remove friction & Cost for Live Deployments
- **Product Differentiation:** Support work on  "what makes this different" from average switching software solution available today
- **Non-Functional Support:** Non-Functionals Matter - improvements in DFSP Onboarding time, Cybersecurity & Performance as a Pillar
